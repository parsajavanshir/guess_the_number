# 🎯 Number Guessing Game  

A simple **Number Guessing Game** built with Python as part of the **100 Days of Code** challenge. This project helps reinforce concepts like **variable scope, loops, conditionals, and user input handling**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Random number generation using the `random` module  
✔️ User input handling with feedback for higher/lower guesses  
✔️ Difficulty levels (Easy & Hard)  
✔️ Proper use of **global and local variables**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 3.10 🐍  

## 🎮 How to Play  
1. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. Choose a difficulty level (Easy or Hard).  
3. Try to guess the randomly generated number within the allowed attempts.  
4. Get feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.  
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number or run out of attempts!
